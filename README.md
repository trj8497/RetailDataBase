# retailDB
Retail domain database project for Principles of Database Management at RIT.

## Summary
Your retailer sells a large variety of products at multiple stores. Not all products are at all stores. Pricing may be different at different stores. Each store has its own inventory of products and needs to decide when to reorder and in what quantity. Customers may identify themselves by joining your frequent-shopper program. Others may remain anonymous. Your retailer has a Web site that accepts orders. From a database perspective it is just a special store that has no physical location and has no anonymous customers.

The database tracks inventory at each store, customer purchases (by market basket and by customer, where possible), sales history by store, etc. Various user interfaces and applications access the database to record sales, initiate reorders, process new orders that arrive, etc.
